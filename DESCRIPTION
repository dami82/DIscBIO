Description: An open, multi-algorithmic pipeline for easy, fast and efficient analysis 
    of cellular sub-populations and the molecular signatures that characterize them.
    The pipeline consists of four successive steps: data pre-processing,
    cellular clustering with pseudo-temporal ordering, defining differential expressed genes
    and biomarker identification <https://doi.org/10.1101/700989>.
